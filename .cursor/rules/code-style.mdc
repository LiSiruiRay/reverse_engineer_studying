You should always add the following to the start of a file without breaking the grammar (e.g. write in command in the code files)
```
# Author: @Ray Li
# Date: <current date>
# Description: <Code Description>
```
Notice you need to use the `time` mcp for the current date not giving out a random current date (The project is created on 2025-Aug-15).

Don't add the `#` for md files when adding the author info, it will make it a tile.

# before coding
- Always refer to the docs folder for previous code and general structure of the codebase
  
# after coding
- Always update docs or write new docs to record the updated project structure

# System
- I am using MacOS with M4 chip

# Python code
- use UV to manage the project
- should have type hint always
- have good amount of comments, both inline and at the start of the block

# Doc writing
Remember to update the doc when there is an update in the structure in the project

Every of our conversation you should put it in the conv_logs folder. Name it with "{time}_{summary}_problem.md", "{time}_generativeUI_solution.md", "{time}_{summary}_feat.md". Also things "{time}_PRD_update.md"
